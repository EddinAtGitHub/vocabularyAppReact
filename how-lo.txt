3. Or you can install chocolatey/choco and it will help you fast to install Node and NPM 

4. Unzip vocabulary-app.zip
5. Open a shell and navigate to the folder /vocabulary-app
6. Run npm i (It will create the needed libs and packages)
7. Run npm start

8. Additionally i created data.json only for quick start purposes. If you copy manually the content of the json file and add it to localStorage with "vocabularyList"
the app will automatically load the list and display it at the beginning. You add new words and you will find also a save button that will persistent your adds into the localStorage directly
It acts like a small database that you can extend anytime
